This is a Card Game based on another project's idea for a combat system. There will be card based combat like Slay the Spire.

Site Used to make Sprites is: https://www.piskelapp.com

Current Card Base, to start making other cards. Hopfully, all cards will be sprite assests we will store, and call at runtime. The card below will need to be stretched to look more card like, but all cards use this as a base layer tp be built apon.
